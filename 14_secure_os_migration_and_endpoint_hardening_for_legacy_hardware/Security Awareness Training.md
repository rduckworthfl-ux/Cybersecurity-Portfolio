### Staying Safe on Your Upgraded Laptop

Your laptop is now running a new system called Lubuntu, which is faster and safer for you. We've also added some extra security features. Here are a few simple tips to help keep you safe online:

1.  **Be Careful What You Click:**
    * **Emails & Links:** If you get an email from someone you don't know, or even from someone you do know but it looks strange (bad spelling, urgent requests for money or information), **don't click any links or open attachments**. It's best to delete it or ask someone you trust first.
    * **Websites:** Stick to websites you know. If a website pops up asking for personal information or saying your computer has a virus, it's usually fake. Just close the window.

2.  **Downloads:**
    * Only download files or programs from official sources. If a website offers a "free" program or file that seems too good to be true, it might contain something harmful.
    * **Scanning Downloads:** We've installed an antivirus tool called `ClamTk`. If you download a file and feel unsure about it, you can open `ClamTk` (look for it in the menu) and use it to scan the specific file or your 'Downloads' folder.

3.  **Passwords:**
    * Keep the password you created for logging into the laptop safe. Don't write it down where others can easily find it.
    * Use different, strong passwords for important online accounts (like banking or email).

4.  **Updates:**
    * Your laptop is set up to install important **security updates automatically**. Sometimes, it might ask you if you want to install *other* non-security updates. It's usually safe to click "Install Now" or "Apply" when you see the update notification, especially if it mentions security. If it asks you to restart afterward, please do so when convenient.

5.  **Built-in Protection:**
    * **Firewall:** We've enabled a basic firewall (`ufw`) that helps block unwanted connections from the internet. You don't need to do anything with this; it works in the background.
    * **Ad Blocker:** Your web browser (Firefox) now has an ad blocker (`uBlock Origin`) installed. This helps block annoying and sometimes malicious advertisements, making browsing safer and faster.

6.  **Physical Safety:** Remember to keep your laptop safe just like any valuable item. Don't leave it unattended in public places.

By following these simple tips, you can enjoy your faster, more secure laptop! If anything seems strange or worrying, always ask for help.
