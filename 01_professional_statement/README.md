> **Security Software Engineer | DevSecOps Specialist** > **Ryan Duckworth**
> Technical security practitioner who bridges the gap between software engineering and offensive security operations. As the Lead Developer of **Vappler**, an enterprise-grade Vulnerability Assessment Platform, I architected a full-stack solution (React, Flask, Supabase) that automates network reconnaissance and risk prioritization.
> My work goes beyond standard scanning; I engineered a proprietary **Attack Path Probability Engine** utilizing Graph Theory (NetworkX) to model lateral movement and identify "Crown Jewel" exposure risks. This experience is backed by a robust operational portfolio, including automating Access Control Lists (ACLs) with Python, hardening Linux environments against privilege escalation, and mitigating live DoS attacks using the NIST framework. I build secure, scalable tools that empower organizations to detect, analyze, and remediate threats faster.
