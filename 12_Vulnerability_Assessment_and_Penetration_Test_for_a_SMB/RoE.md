# Rules of Engagement (RoE)
## Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Test

---

### **1. Introduction**

This document defines the technical rules and permissions governing the security assessment outlined in the associated Statement of Work (SOW). Adherence to these rules is mandatory to ensure a safe, controlled, and effective test.

### **2. Communication & Incident Handling**

* **Role:** GM

* **Name** Jim Doe

* **Email** JimDoe@example.com

* **Phone** 123-456-7890

* **Primary Client Contact** John Doe

* **Primary Client Email** JohnDoe@example.com

* **Primary Client Phone** 123-567-8901

* **Primary Consultant** Ryan Duckworth

* **Email** rduckworth@aspidasecurity.io

* **Phone** 850-752-2775

* **Primary Contact:** [Your Name/Phone/Email] will serve as the primary point of contact for the assessment team.
* **Critical Findings:** Should a critical vulnerability be discovered that poses an immediate and severe risk (e.g., a live ransomware infection), testing will be halted, and the client will be notified immediately. (This is a standard clause for real-world engagements).
* **Emergency Stop:** Either party may call for an immediate halt to testing by contacting the other party via phone.

### **3. Authorization & Timeline**

* **Authorization:** All testing activities are authorized by the Simulated SMB Client as per the SOW.
* **Testing Window:** Technical testing is permitted to occur 24/7 during the agreed-upon Period of Performance, as this is a non-production lab environment. In a real engagement, this would be restricted to after-hours or specific maintenance windows (i.e. Testing is authorized to occur continuously between 17:00 CST on September 22, 2025, and 08:00 CST on September 24, 2025.)

Any testing outside this window requires explicit written permission from the Client.

### **4. Permitted Activities**

The following activities are permitted against the in-scope target (`192.168.59.130`):

* **Network Reconnaissance:** Port scanning, service enumeration, and OS fingerprinting using tools such as Nmap.
* **Vulnerability Scanning:** Automated scanning for known vulnerabilities using tools such as Nessus.
* **Manual Exploitation:** With the goal of proving impact, manual exploitation of identified critical vulnerabilities is permitted. This includes attempts to gain shell access or retrieve non-sensitive system files as proof of compromise.
* **Safe Exploitation:** Controlled exploitation of identified vulnerabilities to demonstrate impact (e.g., gaining a remote shell).

### **5. Prohibited Activities**

The following activities are strictly prohibited:

* **Denial of Service (DoS):** No intentional DoS or resource exhaustion attacks are permitted.
* **Data Exfiltration:** No sensitive data shall be exfiltrated from the target system. Flag files or system identifiers are sufficient for proof of access.
* **Destructive Actions:** No actions that would intentionally alter, delete, or destroy data or system configurations are permitted.
* **Pivoting:** The compromised system shall not be used as a pivot point to attack other systems, even within the lab environment.
* **Social Engineering:** No social engineering of any kind is permitted.
* **Physical Testing:** No physical access attempts are permitted.

### **6. Handling of Sensitive Information**

Any sensitive information discovered during the assessment will be handled with the utmost care, reported only in the final deliverable, and securely deleted from the Consultant's systems upon completion of the engagement.
