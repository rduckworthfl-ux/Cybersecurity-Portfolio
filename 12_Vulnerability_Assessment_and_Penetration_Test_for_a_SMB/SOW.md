# Statement of Work (SOW)
## Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Test

---

### **1. Parties Involved**

Client: Simulated SMB Network (Represented by the Metasploitable 2 virtual machine)

Consultant: Ryan Duckworth | Aspida Security

### **2. Period of Performance**

The technical assessment will be conducted within a pre-agreed testing window to minimize potential impact on the simulated business operations.

* **Start Date:** September 22, 2025
* **End Date:** September 23, 2025

### **3. Project Overview & Objectives**

This document outlines the terms and scope for a security assessment of the designated internal server, conducted by **[Ryan Duckworth / Aspida Security]** (The Assessor) for the **Simulated SMB Client**.

The primary objective is to identify, validate, and report on security vulnerabilities present on the target system via creation of a comprehensive vulnerability assessment report and performance of a limited penetration test. The goal is to identify, validate, and report on security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by a malicious actor, and to provide actionable recommendations for remediation to reduce the overall risk profile of the asset.

### **4. Scope of Work**

* **Assets in Scope:**
The scope of this engagement is strictly limited to the following asset(s):

* **Asset Hostname:** `Metasploitable 2 Server`
* **Asset IP Address:** `192.168.59.130`
* **Asset Type:** Internal Linux Server
* **Asset Description:** Staging Web & Application Server

* **Assets Out of Scope:***
All other hosts, IP addresses, network devices, and services on the `192.168.59.0/24` subnet are explicitly designated as out of scope. This includes, but is not limited to, the attacker machine (`192.168.59.129`) and any virtual network adapters.

**Explicitly Out of Scope:**
Any other device, IP address, or network segment is considered out of scope. No testing will be performed on assets not explicitly listed above.

### **5. Deliverables**

Upon completion of the assessment, the Assessor will provide a comprehensive report that includes:

1.  **Executive Summary:** A non-technical overview of the engagement's key findings and the associated business risks.
2.  **Technical Findings:** A detailed, prioritized list of all identified vulnerabilities. Each finding will include a description of the vulnerability, the evidence of its existence, and its potential impact.
3.  **Remediation Recommendations:** Actionable, step-by-step guidance for the client's technical team to remediate the identified vulnerabilities.

### **6. Client and Assessor Agreement**

The Client provides authorization for the Assessor to perform the security testing as defined within this Statement of Work. The Assessor agrees to conduct all activities in a professional manner and to keep all findings confidential as per the signed Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).

### **7. Assumptions**

The Consultant will be provided with necessary network access to the in-scope asset from the designated attacker machine.

The target system is a non-production test environment, and any potential for service disruption due to testing is an accepted risk by the Client.
