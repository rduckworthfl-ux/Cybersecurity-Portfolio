Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Test for "Metasploitable 2 Server"
1. Parties Involved

Client: Simulated SMB Network (Represented by the Metasploitable 2 virtual machine)

Consultant: Ryan Duckworth | Aspida Security

2. Period of Performance

Start Date: September 22, 2025

End Date: September 23, 2025

3. Project Objective

The primary objective of this engagement is to conduct a comprehensive vulnerability assessment and limited penetration test against the specified target system. The goal is to identify, validate, and report on security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by a malicious actor, and to provide actionable recommendations for remediation to reduce the overall risk profile of the asset.

4. Scope of Work

The scope of this assessment is strictly limited to the assets defined below. Any testing of systems not explicitly listed is forbidden.

4.1. Assets In Scope

Hostname

IP Address

Description

metasploitable.localdomain

192.168.XXX.XXX

Staging Web & Application Server

4.2. Assets Out of Scope

All other hosts, IP addresses, network devices, and services on the 192.168XXXX0/24 subnet are explicitly designated as out of scope. This includes, but is not limited to, the attacker machine (192.168.XXX.XXX) and any virtual network adapters.

5. Deliverables

Upon completion of the engagement, the Consultant will provide the Client with a detailed report containing the following sections:

Executive Summary: A high-level, non-technical overview of the key findings and associated business risks.

Technical Findings: A detailed, prioritized list of all identified vulnerabilities, including their severity (CVSS score), description, and evidence of their existence (proof of concept).

Remediation Recommendations: Actionable steps for the Client's technical team to remediate each identified vulnerability.

6. Assumptions

The Consultant will be provided with necessary network access to the in-scope asset from the designated attacker machine.

The target system is a non-production test environment, and any potential for service disruption due to testing is an accepted risk by the Client.
